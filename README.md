# Next.js 15 Image Loading Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications when loading images that do not exist.  The `about.js` file attempts to load an image from a non-existent path. This results in a JavaScript error, which can be problematic in a production environment.

The solution, provided in `aboutSolution.js`, demonstrates a robust way to handle image loading using the `onError` event handler.  This approach prevents the application from crashing and provides a graceful fallback mechanism.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You should see an error in the console.

## Solution

The solution file shows how to use error handling to avoid the application from crashing due to a missing image.
